           <p>So here it is: I've finally taken the time to write up some basic code.
              After completing the beginners' course through Code First: Girls not too long ago,
               I was itching for a chance to put the skills I learned into use and push my web-design skills further; however,
              I realised that I would have to make such an opportunity for myself.</p>
           <p>I may not have a lot of time in the coming weeks to make this blog particularly beautiful, but I hope to
             work on this in the long term, adding features to test out skills and also commenting on my day-to-day
             life as a university student.</p>
            <p>This next year marks the cutting of my 'safety net' that education has afforded me these past years. After I graduate, I'll
              (hopefully) find a position where I will be forced to adapt to a new working environment: I hope that I find something that challenges me, educates me,
              and ultimately gives me a feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day.</p>
